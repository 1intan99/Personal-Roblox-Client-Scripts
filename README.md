<h2 align="center"> I EXPLOIT ON RŌBLOX AND HAVE NO SHAME IN SAYİNG IT! </h2>

To view a log of stuff players said as I went along my exploiting misadventures, follow [this Discord invite link](https://discord.gg/TSXNHDsrsT) and realise that I've consolidated the chat stream into a server designed to promote [my most ambitious showcase yet](https://www.roblox.com/games/4794911592)!

## `/logs` Folder

In the case more than 1000 files appear in that directory, you can get the URLs of all of them through the following command line. You can pipe the result of this command to filter further.

```bash
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/Windows81/Personal-Roblox-Client-Scripts/contents/logs?ref=main"|grep -Po "(?<=html_url....).+\.txt"
```

To pipe and sort the results by date:

```bash
|sort -k 1.91
```
